Should it be used for all quantum circuits, or are there specific scenarios where applying a noise model is particularly relevant? For example, are there certain types of quantum algorithms or certain types of quantum hardware where noise modeling is more critical? How does one determine the appropriate noise model to use, and what are the implications of using different noise models on the outcomes of quantum computations?

It showcases the use of the `QuantumCircuit` class to define the circuit, the `transpile` function to adapt the circuit to a specific backend, and the `plot_histogram` function to visualize the results. The circuit itself is a simple demonstration of quantum entanglement, where the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other. The histogram plot displays the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes, providing insight into the behavior of the quantum circuit.\n",

      "This code snippet demonstrates the creation and simulation of a simple quantum circuit using Qiskit, along with the visualization of the resulting state vector and density matrix. The circuit is composed of two qubits, with a Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit and a controlled-NOT gate between the two qubits. The state vector is obtained by simulating the circuit, and then it is converted to a density matrix. The code generates three plots: the probabilities of the state vector, the real part of the density matrix, and the imaginary part of the density matrix. These visualizations provide insight into the quantum state and its properties.\n",
