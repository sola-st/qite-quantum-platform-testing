We have three quantum computing platforms: Qiskit, PennyLane, and Pytket. We conducted a cross-platform test campaign on the quantum circuits using two oracles:
- Crash Oracle: we checked if the export and import of the QASM files crashes the platform. We export with a platform and import it back with the same platform and the other two platforms. In total we have 9 tests.
- Differential Testing Oracle: we used a tool called QCEC to check if the circuits are equivalent. We have three circuits to compare, thus we have 3 tests, one for each pair.
Sometime the exporter fail thus we have less tests because we have less QASM files to compare or to import back.
The experimental setup for file: {{file_name}}
Led to the following qasm files:
{{list_of_qasm_files}}
And the following error messages. Note that for each error message we have the stack trace and the involved functions, the involved functions are of the form: export_to_qasm_with_{platform}, import_from_qasm_with_{platform}, compare_qasm_via_qcec.
{{list_of_error_messages}}
We want to report the error:
{{error_message_in_JSON}}
What is the most likely platform to send the bug report to?
Make sure to consider also the stack trace and the error clue of all the error messages.
Return only the platform name string (lowercase) and the reason (as string) in JSON format:
{
  "platform": "...",
  "reason": "..."
}
